	<h1>Time, Space, Complexity</h1>
    
    <p>
        Time complexity is a crucial concept in computer science and algorithms. It refers to the amount of time an algorithm takes to complete its task as a function of the input size. In simpler terms, it measures how efficient an algorithm is in terms of time. We use time complexity to analyze and compare different algorithms, helping us choose the most efficient one for a specific problem.

        <b>Space Complexity</b>, on the other hand, focuses on the amount of memory or storage space an algorithm uses in relation to the input size. It is often denoted as O(n), where 'n' represents the input size. Space complexity helps us understand the memory requirements of an algorithm and is essential for optimizing memory usage, especially in situations with limited resources.
